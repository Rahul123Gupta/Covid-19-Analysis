🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & Prediction using Python
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the global and Indian trends of COVID-19 cases using Python.
It includes data visualization, trend analysis, and time-series forecasting to predict the future number of cases.

Through this project, I aimed to explore how data science techniques such as data cleaning, visualization, and forecasting can help understand real-world pandemic data.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains COVID-19 records with the following information:

Number of confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases

Data for India and the world

Format: .csv and .xlsx

🧰 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – For data manipulation and cleaning

Plotly – For interactive visualizations

Facebook Prophet – For time series forecasting

NumPy – For numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – For static data visualization

📊 Key Tasks Performed

Combined multiple data files using pandas

Cleaned and transformed the dataset

Created interactive visualizations with Plotly

Built a time-series forecasting model using Facebook Prophet

Predicted the number of cases expected in the next week

Visualized both actual and predicted trends

📈 Sample Insights

Identified rising and falling trends in infection and recovery rates

Predicted weekly case counts with confidence intervals

Compared the trends between India and the global dataset
